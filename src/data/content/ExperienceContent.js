            "experienceDescription": "I was privileged enough to be part of the Center for Advanced Studies Team at IBM Markham! As a S.W.A.T. Team developer intern, I helped manage a full stack application that used Angular JS and Node.JS, as well as Dockers as well. My other responsibilities also included managing the team’s websites, which were build and managed on a WebSphere Application Server (WAS). Not only that, but the position also included presenting and delivering workshops to clients and students, and due to this I also got familiar with the IBM cloud tools, such as the artificial intelligence and machine learning with IBM Watson. This internship provided many amazing experiences! I assisted the team in presenting EVOKE CASCON, a convention combining academia and industry with 1000+ attendees (from which is the picture you see here of me with my team). There was a fair amount of travel involved, and I traveled to Montreal as well as Ottawa to deliver workshops for my team. I was lucky enough to be able to go to Chicago to present a workshop on IBM Watson tools as part of my internship as well! I’m very thankful for the opportunity to not only learn more about emerging technology but to also meet many fascinating individuals pioneering the next ideas to change the world.",

            "experienceDescription": "I was fortunate enough to be able to participate in the IBM North America Hackathon during my time on Internship at IBM! We managed to win first place in the Canadian division with our concept, the Smart Food Saver (SFS). The SFS utilizes IBM Machine Learning to analyse food waste being produced from small businesses and uses it to help optimize how much food and ingredients should be ordered. It also factors in how much the business might sell of certain items as well using data from the Weather Company. I’m glad I did this, not only did we work on something that is very close to me (My parents own a café) but I also got to use Machine Learning and AI in a practical application. Also, first place comes with iPad Minis so that didn’t hurt either.",

            "date": ["May 2017", "July 2019"],
            "experienceDescription": "I helped start Schulich Ignite, a club at the University of Calgary that aims to inspire students in programming. We recruit High School Students who have never programmed before and provide them with weekly sessions to teach them how to code. By choosing Processing, a very visual and artistic framework for Java, we aim for the student to be able to play around and teach them that coding is fun! The goal of the club is to ignite their passion for programming, pun fully intended. I not only mentored the students for the years I participated, but for my last year I was a co-president of the club and helped run administrative duties as well.",
