            "bio":"I am a fourth year Software Engineering Student at the Schulich School of Engineering. I am able to develop in full stack design using technologies such as Angular, React, Apache and Node.js. I am also well versed in object oriented languages like Java and C/C++ and can develop applications with these tools as well. I see programming as a fun and exciting tool to help me explore emerging technology and to improve our lives in an increasingly dynamic and interconnected world. When I am not infront of a computer, I also enjoy spending my free time cooking in the kitchen. I am constantly brainstorming for a project to combine my two passions into one!",
