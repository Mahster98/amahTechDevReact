    bio: "I am a Software Engineering graduate from the Schulich School of Engineering. I’m skilled in full stack design, from frontend technologies like Angular and React, to backend tools like Node.js. Along with scripting languages like JavaScript and Bash, I’m also proficient in object-oriented languages like C/C++, Java and Python. I love computers and appreciate being able to create programs to make my life easier. When I am not in front of a computer, I enjoy spending my free time cooking in the kitchen. Much like with programming, I relish seeing my hard work, attention to detail and effort transformed into something fantastic (and tasty)! ",
