Itâ€™s a great opportunity for me to practice not only my HTML and CSS skills, but my front end design as well (this is built using React as a framework). I aim to continually update, redesign and improve not only the content but the user experience of this site as well so stay turned for changes!",

            "projectDescription": "This was a small game that I created under a NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council) grant. The aim of the game was to draw paths to lead the black square to the red squares, which is to help illustrate some problems that happen when trying to optimize the clock in modern circuits. I enjoyed this project because it was a great experience to develop designs and ideas independently and end up with a final project that I could show on my phone!",
